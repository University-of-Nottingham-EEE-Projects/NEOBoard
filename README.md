# NEOBoard - Nottingham Electronics Outreach Board Arduino NANO Every Controlled Electronic Dice

This GitHub project contains all of the files needed to build your own 'NEOBoard' Within this project, the example code is included alongside a digital copy of the printed walkthrough handout as well as the PCB schematic and gerber files. Feel free to use and modify the example in order to create your own versions, or take the Arduino NANO Every and use it in an entirely different project - we would love to see what you end up creating!; share these with us by emailing nathaniel.dacombe@nottingham.ac.uk

Feel free to also contact us by emailing nathaniel.dacombe@nottingham.ac.uk with any queries, questions or feedback

Now for some notes about the example code...
- all note tones and songs are taken from:	https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs/tree/master by Robson Couto
- comments are added throughout the code for your understanding to explain key processes or functions - if anything is unclear, feel free to ask, or search for the functions online

Finally, enjoy and happy rolling!
